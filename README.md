This is a public repo of Intentionally Vulnerable Android Apps that can be used to practice Android App Pentesting

All rights are owned by their respective owners and creators. I have simply assembled my favourite apps at a single place for ease of access. 

1. DIVA (diva-beta.apk): Damn Insecure and Vulnerable Application by Payatu Labs

2. Sieve (sieve.apk): Intentionally Vulnerable Password Manager to be used with Drozer (or MobSF). App developed by MWRLabs

3. InsecureBankv2 (InsecureBankv2.apk): To be used to practice Android Pentesting via Burp Suite. App developed by Dinesh Shetty (https://github.com/dineshshetty/Android-InsecureBankv2)

The compilation of these apps are just for practice and no ill-will intended whatsoever.
